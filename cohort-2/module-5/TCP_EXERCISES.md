# TCP Exercises

For each of these exercises, you will need to send some data to a server I have set up, and should
expect to see a response.

All of these exercises use the protocol outlined in class, also repeated below:

A successful answer should start with `ANS`, and question that was invalid or otherwise was unable
to be processed will start with `ERR`. If you received a response that starts with `ERR`, try your
best to ensure that you are sending the correct data, and if you have trouble, we can go over it
more deeply. Please note down your responses and turn them in on google classroom.

The server's ip address is `module5.tk`
The server is running on tcp port `4000`

## Questions to ask the server

1. What time is it?
2. How many cpus do you have?
3. What is your favorite operating system?
4. What day is it?
5. What is your favorite flower?
5. What is your favorite car?
