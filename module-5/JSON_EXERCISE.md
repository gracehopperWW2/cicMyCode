# JSON Exercise

The server's hostname is `module5.tk`
The server is running on tcp port `80` (standard http port)


## Exercise 1
In the javascript console, convert this string into a javascript object using the native JSON tools in the browser:
```json
{"menu":{"id":"file","value":"File","popup":[{"value":"New","onclick":"CreateNewDoc()"},{"value":"Open","onclick":"OpenDoc()"},{"value":"Close","onclick":"CloseDoc()"}]}}
```

#### Optional next steps
- Add a new entry to the `popup` array inside of the JSON string, specifying a new menu item for `Save` that has the `onclick` key equal to `SaveDoc()`. After doing this, re-convert the string into a javascript object and ensure that your object has the new entry in the array.
- What happens when you give the json formatting you are using bad input - does it return null? Throw an error?
- Take a look into the optional `reviver` parameter: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse#Using_the_reviver_parameter. Try out the examples!



## Exercise 2
Convert the below javascript object into a JSON object:

```
{
  counts: [150, 12, 4, 37],
  start: '5:00',
  end: '8:00'
}
```

#### Optional next steps
- Can you make the json output string span multiple lines and be properly indented? In other words, look like the below when it's outputted? You may need to look this one up online if you can't figure it out on your own!
```
{
  "counts": [150, 12, 4, 37],
  "start": "5:00",
  "end": "8:00"
}
```
- Take a look into the optional `replacer` parameter: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#The_replacer_parameter


## Exercise 3
Using your knowledge of the JSON format, build a json object by hand inside of a string that follows this format:
- The json object contains a key of `students` that maps to a value of an array.
  - The array contains a single value, a string of your name!
- The json object contains another key of `instructor` that maps to a value of `Ryan`
- The json object contains one final key of `moduleNumber` that maps to the value `5`

To check your work, try using the browser json parsing function to see if your json can be properly decded. If not, you will get an error.

#### Optional next steps
- Add a student to the `students` array in the JSON named `John "Jacob Jingleheimer" Schmidt`.
- Change every student entry in the `students` array from a `string` to an `object` with two keys in it:
  - first, a `name` key, that maps to the existing student's name
  - second, a `favoriteTeacherName` key that maps to a `string` equal to the name of the student's favorite teacher.


## Exercise 4

Make a GET request to the server's `/json` endpoint. Note down the response headers and response
body.

#### Optional next steps
(none for this exercise)

## Exercise 5

Make a GET request to the server's `/number-list` endpoint using `axios`. Write a program to extract the array of
numbers from the response (the response is encoded as json) and sum them all up. Use `console.log` to print out the result to the console.

#### Optional next steps
- Try doing something else to the numbers - maybe subtract them instead of adding them?
- Try looping through the array in reverse instead when you do your calculation.
